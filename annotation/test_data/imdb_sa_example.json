Creed's new neighbor Jud (played Fred Gwyne) explains burial ground behind pet cemetery. burial ground pure evil. Jud tells Louis Creed bury human (or kind pet) burial ground, would come back life. problem, come back, person, they're evil. Soon Jud explains everything Pet Sematary, everything starts go hell. wont explain anymore don't want give away main parts film. acting Pet Sematary pretty good, needed little bit work. story one main parts movie, mainly original gripping. film features lots make-up effects make movie way eerie, frightening. One basic reasons movie sent chills back, fact make-up effects. one character film truly freaky. character \"Zelda.\" particular character pops film three times precise. Zelda Rachel Creed's sister passed away years before, Rachel still haunted her. first time Zelda appears movie isn't generally scary isn't talking anything, second time worst, honest, second time scares living **** me. absolutely nothing wrong movie, almost perfect. Pet Sematary delivers great scares, pretty good acting, first rate plot, mesmerizing make-up. truly one favorite horror films time. 10 10."

However, movie falls short conveying overall intentions play ridiculous musical sequences. Add Alicia Silverstone's stumbling dialogue (reminiscent Keanu Reeves Much Ado Nothing) poorly cast roles, equals excruciating endurance viewing."

Stella Claire, independent, free-spirited single woman gets pregnant refuses help boyfriend (Stephen Collins) friend (John Goodman underrated performance). raises daughter Jenny played sweetly Trini Alvarado comes conclusion Jenny's father better ultimately makes life-altering decision. film, plenty laughs, tears memorable moments mostly Midler Alvarado. Marsha Mason co-stars Jenny's would-be stepmother, though wealthy turns good influence her. like Midler, Goodman good films plenty emotion you'll enjoy Bette Midler's version STELLA."

Pretty simple way describe entire movie, that's exactly feeling entire movie. Contrary lot people think, movie mafias/drug trade/criminal groups doesn't automatically make great movie, don't forget good storytelling."
