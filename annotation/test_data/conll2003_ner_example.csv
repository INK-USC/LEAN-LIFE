EU rejects German call to boycott British lamb.
The European Commission said on Thursday it disagreed with German advice to consumers to shun British lamb until scientists determine whether mad cow disease can be transmitted to sheep.
Germany's representative to the European Union's veterinary committee Werner Zwingmann said on Wednesday consumers should buy sheepmeat from countries other than Britain until the scientific advice was clearer.
We don't support any such recommendation because we don't see any grounds for it.
"He said a proposal last month by EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler to ban sheep brains, spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains was a highly specific and precautionary move to protect human health."
Fischler proposed EU-wide measures after reports from Britain and France that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) -- mad cow disease.
"Spanish Farm Minister Loyola de Palacio had earlier accused Fischler at an EU farm ministers' meeting of causing unjustified alarm ""through dangerous generalisation""."
Only France and Britain backed Fischler's propsoal.
Germany imported 47600 sheep from Britain last year nearly half of total imports.
It brough in 4275 tonnes of British mutton some 10 percent of overall imports.
