# Contributing to LEAN LIFE

Thank you so much for thinking about contributing!

We take much of our inspiration for the following guidelines from the amazing [snorkel](https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel) project.

As they do, we adhere to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/),
and expect all of our contributors to adhere to it as well.

## PRs

### Submitting PRs

Except in special cases, all PRs should be against `master`.
If you want to add complicated features, please
[stack your PRs](https://graysonkoonce.com/stacked-pull-requests-keeping-github-diffs-small/)
to ensure an effective review process.
It's unlikely that we'll approve any
[single PR over 500 lines](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/11-proven-practices-for-peer-review/index.html).


### Requesting reviews

Direct commits to master are blocked, and PRs require an approving review
to merge into master.
An INK-LAB maintainer will review PRs when:
  * An initial review has been requested
  * A maintainer is tagged in the PR comments and asked to complete a review


### Merging

Once the okay has been gotten from an INK-LAB maintainer, it is up to the PR author to give the final okay on merging.
